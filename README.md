# Heart-Disease-prediction
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on medical attributes. 
# Project Overview
This is a supervised machine learning project where I built a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on clinical attributes.
"I used a dataset with 1026 patient records, covering features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc. The target was binary: presence or absence of heart disease."
# Model Selection
I chose Logistic Regression as my model because:
It’s interpretable.
It performs well on binary classification problems.
It works well when the relationship between features and output is approximately linear.
# Data Preprocessing
“I first checked for null values — there were none. Then I explored feature distributions using describe() and value_counts() to understand the spread. Since all data was numerical, no one-hot encoding was needed.”
# Evaluation
I evaluated the model using accuracy score.
Training Accuracy: ≈85–90%
The model achieved around 85% accuracy on both training and testing sets.
This shows the model generalizes well and is not overfitting.”
